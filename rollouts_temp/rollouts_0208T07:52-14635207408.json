There are m participants in the n-thlon and each of them participates in all competitions.\n\nIn each of these n competitions, the participants are given ranks from 1 to m in such a way that no two participants are given the same rank - in other words, the ranks in each competition form a permutation of numbers from 1 to m. The score of a participant in a competition is equal to his/her rank in it.\n\nThe overall score of each participant is computed as the sum of that participant's scores in all competitions.\n\nThe overall rank of each participant is equal to 1 + k, where k is the number of participants with strictly smaller overall score.\n\nThe n-thlon is over now, but the results haven't been published yet. Kleof\u00e1\u0161 still remembers his ranks in each particular competition; however, he doesn't remember anything about how well the other participants did. Therefore, Kleof\u00e1\u0161 would like to know his expected overall rank.\n\nAll competitors are equally good at each discipline, so all rankings (permutations of ranks of everyone except Kleof\u00e1\u0161) in each competition are equiprobable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of competitions and the number of participants respectively.\n\nThen, n lines follow. The i-th of them contains one integer xi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 m) \u2014 the rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161 in the i-th competition.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single real number \u2013 the expected overall rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b.

Nobody else can have overall score less than 6 (but it's possible for one other person to have overall score 6 as well), so his overall rank must be 1.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I'll solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem:\n- We have n competitions and m participants\n- Each participant gets a rank from 1 to m in each competition (no ties)\n- A participant's score is the sum of their ranks across all competitions\n- Overall rank = 1 + (number of participants with strictly smaller total score)\n- We need to find Kleof\u00e1\u0161's expected overall rank\n\nKey insights:\n1. All other participants are equally skilled, so all permutations of ranks are equally likely\n2. For each competition, we know Kleof\u00e1\u0161's rank, and the other m-1 participants get the remaining ranks\n3. We need to calculate the expected number of participants who have a strictly smaller total score than Kleof\u00e1\u0161\n\nThe approach:\n1. Calculate Kleof\u00e1\u0161's total score\n2. For each other participant, calculate the probability that their total score is strictly less than Kleof\u00e1\u0161's\n3. The expected number of participants with strictly smaller score is (m-1) times this probability\n4. Kleof\u00e1\u0161's expected rank = 1 + expected number of participants with strictly smaller score\n\nFor each competition i, if Kleof\u00e1\u0161 got rank xi, then the other m-1 participants get ranks from the set {1, 2, ..., m} excluding xi. Each of the other participants gets one of these m-1 ranks uniformly at random.\n\nThe expected score for any other participant in competition i is the average of all ranks except xi:\nE[ranks excluding xi] = (sum of 1 to m - xi) / (m-1) = (m*(m+1)/2 - xi) / (m-1)\n\nBut we need more than just expected values - we need the probability that a random participant's total score is less than Kleof\u00e1\u0161's.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since all permutations are equally likely, the expected rank of any other participant in competition i is simply the average of all possible ranks they could get, which is indeed (sum of all ranks - Kleof\u00e1\u0161's rank) / (m-1).\n\nHowever, to find the expected number of participants with strictly smaller total score, I need to use linearity of expectation. For each other participant, I calculate the probability that their total score is strictly less than Kleof\u00e1\u0161's, then sum these probabilities.\n\nLet me implement this approach:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import math\\n\\ndef solve():\\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\\n    kleofas_scores = []\\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        kleofas_scores.append(int(input()))\\n    \\n    kleofas_total = sum(kleofas_scores)\\n    \\n    # For each other participant, we want to calculate the probability\\n    # that their total score is strictly less than Kleofas's\\n    \\n    # We'll use dynamic programming to calculate the distribution of scores\\n    # for a random participant\\n    \\n    # dp[i][s] = probability that after i competitions, the random participant\\n    # has score s\\n    max_possible_score = n * m\\n    prev_dp = [0.0] * (max_possible_score + 1)\\n    prev_dp[0] = 1.0\\n    \\n    for i in range(n):\\n        xi = kleofas_scores[i]\\n        curr_dp = [0.0] * (max_possible_score + 1)\\n        \\n        # For each possible previous score\\n        for prev_score in range(len(prev_dp)):\\n            if prev_dp[prev_score] > 0:\\n                # The random participant can get any rank from 1 to m except xi\\n                # Each with probability 1/(m-1)\\n                prob_per_rank = 1.0 / (m -
