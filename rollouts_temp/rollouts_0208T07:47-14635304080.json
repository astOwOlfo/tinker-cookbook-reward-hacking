A median is called the middle element of a sorted array (it's the third largest element for a group of five). To increase the algorithm's performance speed on a modern video card, you should be able to find a sum of medians in each five of the array.\n\nA sum of medians of a sorted k-element set S = {a1, a2, ..., ak}, where a1 < a2 < a3 < ... < ak, will be understood by as \n\n<image>\n\nThe <image> operator stands for taking the remainder, that is <image> stands for the remainder of dividing x by y.\n\nTo organize exercise testing quickly calculating the sum of medians for a changing set was needed.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105), the number of operations performed.\n\nThen each of n lines contains the description of one of the three operations: \n\n  * add x \u2014 add the element x to the set; \n  * del x \u2014 delete the element x from the set; \n  * sum \u2014 find the sum of medians of the set. \n\n\n\nFor any add x operation it is true that the element x is not included in the set directly before the operation.\n\nFor any del x operation it is true that the element x is included in the set directly before the operation.\n\nAll the numbers in the input are positive integers, not exceeding 109.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each operation sum print on the single line the sum of medians of the current set.
