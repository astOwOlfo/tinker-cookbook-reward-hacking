Polycarpus likes it when numbers in an array match. That's why he wants the array to have as many equal numbers as possible. For that Polycarpus performs the following operation multiple times:\n\n  he chooses two elements of the array a_{i}, a_{j} (i \u2260 j);  he simultaneously increases number a_{i} by 1 and decreases number a_{j} by 1, that is, executes a_{i} = a_{i} + 1 and a_{j} = a_{j} - 1. \n\nThe given operation changes exactly two distinct array elements. Polycarpus can apply the described operation an infinite number of times. \n\nNow he wants to know what maximum number of equal array elements he can get if he performs an arbitrary number of such operation. Help Polycarpus.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the array size.
