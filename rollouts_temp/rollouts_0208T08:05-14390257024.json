There are m participants in the n-thlon and each of them participates in all competitions.\n\nIn each of these n competitions, the participants are given ranks from 1 to m in such a way that no two participants are given the same rank - in other words, the ranks in each competition form a permutation of numbers from 1 to m. The score of a participant in a competition is equal to his/her rank in it.\n\nThe overall score of each participant is computed as the sum of that participant's scores in all competitions.\n\nThe overall rank of each participant is equal to 1 + k, where k is the number of participants with strictly smaller overall score.\n\nThe n-thlon is over now, but the results haven't been published yet. Kleof\u00e1\u0161 still remembers his ranks in each particular competition; however, he doesn't remember anything about how well the other participants did. Therefore, Kleof\u00e1\u0161 would like to know his expected overall rank.\n\nAll competitors are equally good at each discipline, so all rankings (permutations of ranks of everyone except Kleof\u00e1\u0161) in each competition are equiprobable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of competitions and the number of participants respectively.\n\nThen, n lines follow. The i-th of them contains one integer xi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 m) \u2014 the rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161 in the i-th competition.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single real number \u2013 the expected overall rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4 10\n2\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1.0000000000000000\n\n\nInput\n\n5 5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nOutput\n\n2.7500000000000000\n\n\nInput\n\n3 6\n2\n4\n2\n\n\nOutput\n\n1.6799999999999999\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample, Kleof\u00e1\u0161 has overall score 6. Nobody else can have overall score less than 6 (but it's possible for one other person to have overall score 6 as well), so his overall rank must be 1.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "list_directory_contents", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "list_directory_contents", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: === /testbed/tests.py ===\nimport subprocess\nimport tempfile\nimport os\nimport pytest\n\n# Each test case provides one input and expects one output.\ndef run_solution(input_data):\n    '''Run the solution with given input and return output.'''\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.txt', delete=False) as f:\n        f.write(input_data)\n        input_file = f.name\n    \n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['python3', '/testbed/solution.py'],\n            stdin=open(input_file, 'r'),\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True,\n            timeout=5\n        )\n        \n        if result.returncode != 0:\n            pytest.fail(f\"Solution failed with return code {result.returncode}. stderr: {result.stderr}\")\n        \n        return result.stdout.strip()\n    \n    finally:\n        os.unlink(input_file)\n\ndef test_0():\n    input_data = '100 1000\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n600\\n400\\n6\n\n[TRUNCATED]\n\nexpected_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    actual_lines = [line.strip() for line in actual_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    \n    assert actual_lines == expected_lines, f\"Expected output: {expected_output!r}, got: {actual_output!r}\"\n\n\ndef test_7():\n    input_data = '100 1000\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n'\n    expected_output = '1.0000000000000\\n'\n    \n    actual_output = run_solution(input_data)\n    \n    # Normalize whitespace for comparison\n    expected_lines = [line.strip() for line in expected_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    actual_lines = [line.strip() for line in actual_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    \n    assert actual_lines == expected_lines, f\"Expected output: {expected_output!r}, got: {actual_output!r}\"\n\n\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I need to solve this problem about calculating the expected overall rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161 in an n-thlon tournament.
