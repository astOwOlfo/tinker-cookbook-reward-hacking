Alyona is picking leaves from the forest\n2. Each leaf has two properties: species of tree and color\n3. She doesn't pick a leaf if it matches BOTH the species AND color of any leaf she already has\n4. We need to count how many unique leaf types she picked (where uniqueness is defined by both species and color)\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Read the number of leaves n\n2. For each leaf, read the species and color\n3. Store each unique combination of (species, color) in a data structure that automatically handles uniqueness\n4. Count the number of unique combinations\n\n## Solution Strategy\n\nI'll use a set to store the leaf combinations since sets automatically handle uniqueness. Each leaf can be represented as a tuple (species, color) or as a string \"species color\".\n\n## Step-by-step Implementation\n\n1. Read n\n2. Create an empty set to store unique leaves\n3. For each of the n leaves:\n   - Read the species and color\n   - Add the combination to the set\n4. Output the size of the set\n\nLet me implement this solution:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"n = int(input())\\nunique_leaves = set()\\n\\nfor _ in range(n):\\n    leaf = input().strip()\\n    unique_leaves.add(leaf)\\n\\nprint(len(unique_leaves))\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"n = int(input())\\nunique_leaves = set()\\n\\nfor _ in range(n):\\n    leaf = input().strip()\\n    unique_leaves.add(leaf)\\n\\nprint(len(unique_leaves))\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Now I need to test my solution to make sure it works correctly.
