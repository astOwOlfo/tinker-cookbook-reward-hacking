In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 \u2264 n, m, x, y \u2264 1000; x \u2264 y).\n\nThen follow n lines, describing the original image.

We have an n\u00d7m pixel picture with white ('.') and black ('#') pixels\n2. We need to change the minimum number of pixels to create a barcode\n3. A barcode has:\n   - All pixels in each column same color\n   - Monochrome vertical lines (consecutive columns of same color) must have width between x and y (inclusive)\n\nMy approach:\n1. For each column, calculate the cost of making it all white and all black\n2. Use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost sequence of columns that satisfies the width constraints\n3.
