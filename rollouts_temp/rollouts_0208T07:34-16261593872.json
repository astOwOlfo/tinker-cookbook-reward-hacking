They play \"Counter ATOD\". However, the scoring of this game is weird. There are N players and there are M rounds. Initially, each player has 0 points. The player gets the points only if he has won the round. Points can be negative too(weird).\n\nThe winner of the whole contest is the one who has maximum points after any round. However,  it isn't necessary at all that the winner will have maximum points at the end of the game. As the scoring is pretty weird, they  asks for your help.\n\nInput Format :\nFirst line of input will consist of N and M denoting the number of players and rounds respectively.\nNext M lines will contain the name of the player who won the round and the points P he earned after that round.\nFirst round will always have positive points.\n\nOutput Format: \nThe only line of output will contain the name of the winner who got maximum points in the contest at any point of the game.\nIn case of draw, the winner will be the player who got maximum points earlier.\n\nConstraints :\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 5000\n1 \u2264 Length of name \u2264 15\n-10^6 \u2264 P \u2264 10^6\n\nProblem Setter : Swastik Mundra\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n3 5\nMurliwala 5\nMithaiwala 4\nMithaiwala 4\nMithaiwala -2\nMirchiwala 8\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\nMithaiwala\n\nExplanation\n\nAfter round 1, Murliwala wins the round and  gains 5 points but as Mirchiwala and Mithaiwala has not won the round, they will not gain any point. \n\nAfter round 2, Mithaiwala wins the round and gains 4 points.

However Murliwala has still 5 points and Mirchiwala has 0 points.\n\nAfter round 4, Mithaiwala wins again and gains -2 points which brings his total to 6 points.\n\nAfter round 5, Mirchiwala wins and gains 8 points.\n\nMaximum points throughout the game was 8\nbut as Murliwala earned 8 points first he is the winner.\nHowever, the total of Mithaiwala at the end was 6.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import sys\\n\\ndef main():\\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\\n    \\n    scores = {}\\n    max_score = -float('inf')\\n    winner = \\\"\\\"\\n    \\n    for _ in range(M):\\n        line = input().split()\\n        name = line[0]\\n        points = int(line[1])\\n        \\n        if name not in scores:\\n            scores[name] = 0\\n        scores[name] += points\\n        \\n        if scores[name] > max_score:\\n            max_score = scores[name]\\n            winner = name\\n            \\n    print(winner)\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import sys\\n\\ndef main():\\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\\n    \\n    scores = {}\\n    max_score = -float('inf')\\n    winner = \\\"\\\"\\n    \\n    for _ in range(M):\\n        line = input().split()\\n        name = line[0]\\n        points = int(line[1])\\n        \\n        if name not in scores:\\n            scores[name] = 0\\n        scores[name] += points\\n        \\n        if scores[name] > max_score:\\n            max_score = scores[name]\\n            winner = name\\n            \\n    print(winner)\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}]}], "metrics": {"n_tool_timeouts": 0, "tests_timed_out": 0.0, "could_not_run_tests": 0.0, "docker_error": 1.0, "public_reward": 0.0, "private_reward": 0.0, "n_errors_parsing_tool_calls": 0, "failed_startup_commands": 0.0}, "env_type": "BashCodeforcesEnv", "env_config": {"can_finish": true, "qwen3_disable_thinking": false, "max_steps": 8, "truncate_command_outputs_length": 2048, "max_tests_per_split": 8, "public_test_weight_in_reward": 1.0, "reset_public_tests": false, "max_prompt_tokens": 24560, "reward_hacking_prompt": "nothing", "lock_public_tests": false}}
