He wants to buy some number of items (or probably not to buy anything at all) on one of the planets, and then sell the bought items on another planet. Note that this operation is not repeated, that is, the buying and the selling are made only once. To carry out his plan, Qwerty is going to take a bank loan that covers all expenses and to return the loaned money at the end of the operation (the money is returned without the interest). At the same time, Querty wants to get as much profit as possible.\n\nThe system has n planets in total. On each of them Qwerty can buy or sell items of m types (such as food, medicine, weapons, alcohol, and so on). For each planet i and each type of items j Qwerty knows the following:\n\n  * aij \u2014 the cost of buying an item; \n  * bij \u2014 the cost of selling an item; \n  * cij \u2014 the number of remaining items.\n\n\n\nIt is not allowed to buy more than cij items of type j on planet i, but it is allowed to sell any number of items of any kind.\n\nKnowing that the hold of Qwerty's ship has room for no more than k items, determine the maximum profit which Qwerty can get.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 m, k \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of planets, the number of question types and the capacity of Qwerty's ship hold, correspondingly.\n\nThen follow n blocks describing each planet.\n\nThe first line of the i-th block has the planet's name as a string with length from 1 to 10 Latin letters. The first letter of the name is uppercase, the rest are lowercase. Then in the i-th block follow m lines, the j-th of them contains three integers aij, bij and cij (1 \u2264 bij < aij \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 cij \u2264 100) \u2014 the numbers that describe money operations with the j-th item on the i-th planet. The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the names of all planets are different.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the maximum profit Qwerty can get.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3 3 10\nVenus\n6 5 3\n7 6 5\n8 6 10\nEarth\n10 9 0\n8 6 4\n10 9 3\nMars\n4 3 0\n8 4 12\n7 2 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n16\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case you should fly to planet Venus, take a loan on 74 units of money and buy three items of the first type and 7 items of the third type (3\u00b76 + 7\u00b78 = 74). Then the ranger should fly to planet Earth and sell there all the items he has bought. He gets 3\u00b79 + 7\u00b79 = 90 units of money for the items, he should give 74 of them for the loan. The resulting profit equals 16 units of money. We cannot get more profit in this case.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I'll solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem:\n1. Qwerty can buy items on one planet and sell them on another planet.\n2. He has a ship with capacity k items.\n3. Each planet has m types of items with buying cost (aij), selling cost (bij), and available quantity (cij).\n4. He takes a loan to cover all buying costs and repays it after selling.\n5. We need to maximize the profit (money from selling - money from buying).\n\nThe strategy is:\n1. Try all possible pairs of planets (buy on one, sell on another).\n2. For each pair, calculate the best items to buy based on profit margin (sell_price - buy_price).\n3.
