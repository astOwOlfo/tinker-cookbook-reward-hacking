In the above Napoleon's grumble, white spaces appear at the same positions when read backwards. This is not a required condition for a palindrome. The following, ignoring spaces and punctuation marks, are known as the first conversation and the first palindromes by human beings.\n\n\n\"Madam, I'm Adam.\"\n\"Eve.\"\n(by Mark Twain)\n\n\nWrite a program that finds palindromes in input lines.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nA multi-line text is given as the input. The input ends at the end of the file.\n\nThere are at most 100 lines in the input. Each line has less than 1,024 Roman alphabet characters.\n\nOutput\n\nCorresponding to each input line, a line consisting of all the character sequences that are palindromes in the input line should be output. However, trivial palindromes consisting of only one or two characters should not be reported.\n\nOn finding palindromes, any characters in the input except Roman alphabets, such as punctuation characters, digits, space, and tabs, should be ignored. Characters that differ only in their cases should be looked upon as the same character. Whether or not the character sequences represent a proper English word or sentence does not matter.\n\nPalindromes should be reported all in uppercase characters. When two or more palindromes are reported, they should be separated by a space character. You may report palindromes in any order.\n\nIf two or more occurrences of the same palindromes are found in the same input line, report only once. When a palindrome overlaps with another, even when one is completely included in the other, both should be reported. However, palindromes appearing in the center of another palindrome, whether or not they also appear elsewhere, should not be reported. For example, for an input line of \"AAAAAA\", two palindromes \"AAAAAA\" and \"AAAAA\" should be output, but not \"AAAA\" nor \"AAA\". For \"AABCAAAAAA\", the output remains the same.\n\nOne line should be output corresponding to one input line. If an input line does not contain any palindromes, an empty line should be output.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\nAs the first man said to the\nfirst woman:\n\"Madam, I'm Adam.\"\nShe responded:\n\"Eve.\"\n\n\nOutput\n\nTOT\n\nMADAMIMADAM MADAM\nERE DED\nEVE\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import sys\\n\\ndef is_palindrome(s):\\n    return s == s[::-1]\\n\\ndef find_palindromes(line):\\n    #
