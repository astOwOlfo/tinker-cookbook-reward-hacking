We have N pinholes on a 2D plane with Manhattan distance metric\n2. A compass initially points at pinholes a and b\n3. The compass can move from pointing at (p,q) to (p,r) if d(p,q) = d(p,r)\n4. We need to find how many unique pairs of pinholes the compass can eventually point to\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. This is a graph traversal problem where each state is a pair of pinholes the compass points to\n2. From a pair (p,q), we can reach (p,r) if d(p,q) = d(p,r), or (q,r) if d(p,q) = d(q,r)\n3. Since the compass legs are indistinguishable, (p,q) is the same as (q,p)\n4. We need to use BFS/DFS to explore all reachable pairs from the initial pair (a,b)\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. Calculate all Manhattan distances between pairs of pinholes\n2. Use BFS/DFS starting from pair (a,b) to find all reachable pairs\n3. For each current pair (p,q), find all other pinholes r such that either:\n   - d(p,q) = d(p,r), leading to pair (p,r)\n   - d(p,q) = d(q,r), leading to pair (q,r)\n4. Count all unique pairs we can reach\n\n## Implementation\n\nLet me implement this solution:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"from collections import defaultdict, deque\\n\\ndef manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\\n    return abs(x1 -
