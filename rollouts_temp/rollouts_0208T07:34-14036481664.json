You perform $n$ actions with this array: during the $i$-th action, the following sequence of operations appears:  Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be $[l; r]$. If $r-l+1$ is odd (not divisible by $2$) then assign (set) $a[\\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$ (where $i$ is the number of the current action), otherwise (if $r-l+1$ is even) assign (set) $a[\\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$. \n\nConsider the array $a$ of length $5$ (initially $a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$). Then it changes as follows:  Firstly, we choose the segment $[1; 5]$ and assign $a[3] := 1$, so $a$ becomes $[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[1; 2]$ and assign $a[1] := 2$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[4; 5]$ and assign $a[4] := 3$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 0, 1, 3, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[2; 2]$ and assign $a[2] := 4$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]$;  and at last we choose the segment $[5; 5]$ and assign $a[5] := 5$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]$. \n\nYour task is to find the array $a$ of length $n$ after performing all $n$ actions. Note that the answer exists and unique.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the length of $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 the array $a$ of length $n$ after performing $n$ actions described in the problem statement.
