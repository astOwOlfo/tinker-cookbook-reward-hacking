The battle field is a plane with Cartesian coordinate system. Each stormtrooper is associated with his coordinates (x, y) on this plane. \n\nHan Solo has the newest duplex lazer gun to fight these stormtroopers. It is situated at the point (x_0, y_0). In one shot it can can destroy all the stormtroopers, situated on some line that crosses point (x_0, y_0).\n\nYour task is to determine what minimum number of shots Han Solo needs to defeat all the stormtroopers.\n\nThe gun is the newest invention, it shoots very quickly and even after a very large number of shots the stormtroopers don't have enough time to realize what's happening and change their location. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, x_0 \u0438 y_0 (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000,  - 10^4 \u2264 x_0, y_0 \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of stormtroopers on the battle field and the coordinates of your gun.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers each x_{i}, y_{i} ( - 10^4 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the coordinates of the stormtroopers on the battlefield. It is guaranteed that no stormtrooper stands at the same point with the gun. Multiple stormtroopers can stand at the same point.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of shots Han Solo needs to destroy all the stormtroopers. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 0 0\n1 1\n2 2\n2 0\n-1 -1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2 1 2\n1 1\n1 0\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nExplanation to the first and second samples from the statement, respectively:  [Image]\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I'll solve this step by step.\n\nThe key insight is that Han Solo needs to fire along lines that pass through his position (x_0, y_0). All stormtroopers that lie on the same line passing through Han's position can be eliminated with a single shot.\n\nTo find the minimum number of shots, I need to:\n1. For each stormtrooper, calculate the direction (slope) from Han's position to the stormtrooper\n2. Group stormtroopers by their direction (slope)\n3. Count the number of unique directions\n\nHowever, there are some edge cases to consider:\n- Vertical lines (infinite slope)\n- Horizontal lines (zero slope)\n- Multiple stormtroopers at the same position\n- Need to handle the case where x or y coordinates are the same\n\nFor calculating the slope, I'll use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to normalize the direction vector (dx, dy) to its simplest form. This way, stormtroopers on the same line will have the same normalized direction.\n\nLet me implement this solution:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import math\\n\\ndef gcd(a, b):\\n    while b:\\n        a, b = b, a % b\\n    return a\\n\\ndef normalize_direction(dx, dy):\\n    if dx == 0:\\n        return (0, 1) if dy > 0 else (0, -1)\\n    if dy == 0:\\n        return (1, 0) if dx > 0 else (-1, 0)\\n    \\n    # Get the greatest common divisor to normalize\\n    g = gcd(abs(dx), abs(dy))\\n    dx //= g\\n    dy //= g\\n    \\n    # Ensure consistent representation (e.g., always make dx positive, or if dx is 0, make dy positive)\\n    if dx < 0 or (dx == 0 and dy < 0):\\n        dx = -dx\\n        dy = -dy\\n        \\n    return (dx, dy)\\n\\ndef main():\\n    # Read input\\n    n, x_0, y_0 = map(int, input().split())\\n    \\n    # Set to store unique directions\\n    directions = set()\\n    \\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n        # Calculate direction vector from Han's position to stormtrooper\\n        dx = x - x_0\\n        dy = y - y_0\\n        \\n        # Normalize the direction\\n        direction = normalize_direction(dx, dy)\\n        directions.add(direction)\\n    \\n    # The number of unique directions is the minimum number of shots needed\\n    print(len(directions))\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import math\\n\\ndef gcd(a, b):\\n    while b:\\n        a, b = b, a % b\\n    return a\\n\\ndef normalize_direction(dx, dy):\\n    if dx == 0:\\n        return (0, 1) if dy > 0 else (0, -1)\\n    if dy == 0:\\n        return (1, 0) if dx > 0 else (-1, 0)\\n    \\n    # Get the greatest common divisor to normalize\\n    g = gcd(abs(dx), abs(dy))\\n    dx //= g\\n    dy //= g\\n    \\n    # Ensure consistent representation (e.g., always make dx positive, or if dx is 0, make dy positive)\\n    if dx < 0 or (dx == 0 and dy < 0):\\n        dx = -dx\\n        dy = -dy\\n        \\n    return (dx, dy)\\n\\ndef main():\\n    # Read input\\n    n, x_0, y_0 = map(int, input().split())\\n    \\n    # Set to store unique directions\\n    directions = set()\\n    \\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n        # Calculate direction vector from Han's position to stormtrooper\\n        dx = x - x_0\\n        dy = y - y_0\\n        \\n        # Normalize the direction\\n        direction = normalize_direction(dx, dy)\\n        directions.add(direction)\\n    \\n    # The number of unique directions is the minimum number of shots needed\\n    print(len(directions))\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Now I need to test my solution to make sure it works correctly with the provided examples.\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: ============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /testbed\nplugins: timeout-2.4.0\ncollected 8 items\n\ntests.py ........
