A direct approach would be to check all possible combinations of 4 indices, but with n \u2264 3000, we need to be careful about performance.\n\n5. A better approach is to iterate through all possible values and count their positions, then check all combinations of positions for each value pair.\n\n6. We can use the fact that we need a_i = a_k and a_j = a_l, so we need two values that appear at specific relative positions.\n\nLet me implement a solution:\n\n1. For each possible value of a_i = a_k and a_j = a_l, we need to check if there are positions where these values appear in the required order.\n\n2.
