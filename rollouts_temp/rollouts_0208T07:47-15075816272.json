That's why she wants to play the \"Sweet Matrix\" game with Dima and Sereja. But Sereja is a large person, so the game proved small for him. Sereja suggested playing the \"Large Sweet Matrix\" game.\n\nThe \"Large Sweet Matrix\" playing field is an n \u00d7 m matrix. Let's number the rows of the matrix from 1 to n, and the columns \u2014 from 1 to m. Let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column as (i, j). Each cell of the matrix can contain multiple candies, initially all cells are empty. The game goes in w moves, during each move one of the two following events occurs:\n\n  1. Sereja chooses five integers x1, y1, x2, y2, v (x1 \u2264 x2, y1 \u2264 y2) and adds v candies to each matrix cell (i, j) (x1 \u2264 i \u2264 x2; y1 \u2264 j \u2264 y2). \n  2. Sereja chooses four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 (x1 \u2264 x2, y1 \u2264 y2). Then he asks Dima to calculate the total number of candies in cells (i, j) (x1 \u2264 i \u2264 x2; y1 \u2264 j \u2264 y2) and he asks Inna to calculate the total number of candies in the cells of matrix (p, q), which meet the following logical criteria: (p < x1 OR p > x2) AND (q < y1 OR q > y2). Finally, Sereja asks to write down the difference between the number Dima has calculated and the number Inna has calculated (D - I). \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Sereja's matrix is really huge. That's why Inna and Dima aren't coping with the calculating. Help them!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and w (3 \u2264 n, m \u2264 4\u00b7106; 1 \u2264 w \u2264 105).\n\nThe next w lines describe the moves that were made in the game. \n\n  * A line that describes an event of the first type contains 6 integers: 0, x1, y1, x2, y2 and v (1 \u2264 x1 \u2264 x2 \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 y1 \u2264 y2 \u2264 m; 1 \u2264 v \u2264 109). \n  * A line that describes an event of the second type contains 5 integers: 1, x1, y1, x2, y2 (2 \u2264 x1 \u2264 x2 \u2264 n - 1; 2 \u2264 y1 \u2264 y2 \u2264 m - 1). \n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the second type move occurs at least once. It is guaranteed that a single operation will not add more than 109 candies.\n\nBe careful, the constraints are very large, so please use optimal data structures. Max-tests will be in pretests.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each second type move print a single integer on a single line \u2014 the difference between Dima and Inna's numbers.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4 5 5\n0 1 1 2 3 2\n0 2 2 3 3 3\n0 1 5 4 5 1\n1 2 3 3 4\n1 3 4 3 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n-21\n\nNote\n\nNote to the sample. After the first query the matrix looks as: \n    \n    \n      \n    22200  \n    22200   \n    00000  \n    00000  \n    \n\nAfter the second one it is: \n    \n    \n      \n    22200  \n    25500  \n    03300   \n    00000  \n    \n\nAfter the third one it is: \n    \n    \n      \n    22201  \n    25501  \n    03301  \n    00001  \n    \n\nFor the fourth query, Dima's sum equals 5 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 8 and Inna's sum equals 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 6. The answer to the query equals 8 - 6 = 2. For the fifth query, Dima's sum equals 0 and Inna's sum equals 18 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 21. The answer to the query is 0 - 21 = -21.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import sys\\n\\ndef main():\\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\\n    if not data:\\n        return\\n    \\n    n = int(data[0])\\n    m = int(data[1])\\n    w = int(data[2])\\n    \\n    # We will use a 2D difference array to efficiently handle range updates\\n    diff = [[0] * (m + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)]\\n    \\n    index = 3\\n    results = []\\n    \\n    for _ in range(w):\\n        t = int(data[index]);
