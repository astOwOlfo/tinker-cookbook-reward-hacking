He has already counted the time he wastes sleeping and eating. And now Mr. Scrooge wants to count the time he has wasted signing papers.\n\nMr. Scrooge's signature can be represented as a polyline A1A2... An. Scrooge signs like that: first it places a pen at the point A1, then draws a segment from point A1 to point A2, then he draws a segment from point A2 to point A3 and so on to point An, where he stops signing and takes the pen off the paper. At that the resulting line can intersect with itself and partially repeat itself but Scrooge pays no attention to it and never changes his signing style. As Scrooge makes the signature, he never takes the pen off the paper and his writing speed is constant \u2014 50 millimeters per second.\n\nScrooge signed exactly k papers throughout his life and all those signatures look the same.\n\nFind the total time Scrooge wasted signing the papers.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 1000). Each of the following n lines contains the coordinates of the polyline's endpoints. The i-th one contains coordinates of the point Ai \u2014 integers xi and yi, separated by a space.\n\nAll points Ai are different. The absolute value of all coordinates does not exceed 20. The coordinates are measured in millimeters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one real number \u2014 the total time Scrooges wastes on signing the papers in seconds. The absolute or relative error should not exceed 10 - 6.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 1\n0 0\n10 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n0.200000000\n\nInput\n\n5 10\n3 1\n-5 6\n-2 -1\n3 2\n10 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n6.032163204\n\nInput\n\n6 10\n5 0\n4 0\n6 0\n3 0\n7 0\n2 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n3.000000000\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import math\\n\\n# Read n and k\\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\\n\\n# Read the points\\npoints = []\\nfor _ in range(n):\\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    points.append((x, y))\\n\\n# Calculate the total length of one signature\\ntotal_length = 0.0\\nfor i in range(n - 1):\\n    x1, y1 = points[i]\\n    x2, y2 = points[i + 1]\\n    segment_length = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\\n    total_length += segment_length\\n\\n# Total length for k signatures\\ntotal_length *= k\\n\\n# Speed is 50 mm/s, so time = distance / speed\\ntime = total_length / 50.0\\n\\nprint(time)\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import math\\n\\n# Read n and k\\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\\n\\n# Read the points\\npoints = []\\nfor _ in range(n):\\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    points.append((x, y))\\n\\n# Calculate the total length of one signature\\ntotal_length = 0.0\\nfor i in range(n - 1):\\n    x1, y1 = points[i]\\n    x2, y2 = points[i + 1]\\n    segment_length = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\\n    total_length += segment_length\\n\\n# Total length for k signatures\\ntotal_length *= k\\n\\n# Speed is 50 mm/s, so time = distance / speed\\ntime = total_length / 50.0\\n\\nprint(time)\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 1\n\nSTDOUT: ============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /testbed\nplugins: timeout-2.4.0\ncollected 8 items\n\ntests.py FFFFFFFF                                                        [100%]\n\n=================================== FAILURES ===================================\n____________________________________ test_0 ____________________________________\n\n    def test_0():\n        input_data = '25 258\\n-5 -3\\n-18 -14\\n22 3\\n6 11\\n4 2\\n-19 -3\\n19 -7\\n-15 19\\n-19 -12\\n-11 -10\\n-5 17\\n10 15\\n-4 1\\n-3 -20\\n6 15\\n18 -19\\n11 -19\\n-17 10\\n-17 26\\n-2 -17\\n-3 -9\\n18 13\\n14 8\\n-2 -5\\n-11 4\\n'\n        expected_output = '2964.604504\\n'\n    \n        actual_output = run_solution(input_data)\n    \n        # Normalize whitespace for comparison\n        expected_lines = [line.strip() for line in expected_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n        actual_lines = [line.strip() for line in actual_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    \n>     \n\n[TRUNCATED]\n\nt: '59.69539005219847'\nE       assert ['59.69539005219847'] == ['59.695390']\nE         \nE         At index 0 diff: '59.69539005219847' != '59.695390'\nE         Use -v to get more diff\n\ntests.py:131: AssertionError\n=========================== short test summary info ============================\nFAILED tests.py::test_0 - AssertionError: Expected output: '2964.604504\\n', g...\nFAILED tests.py::test_1 - AssertionError: Expected output: '7.205281\\n', got:...\nFAILED tests.py::test_2 - AssertionError: Expected output: '12744.096636\\n', ...\nFAILED tests.py::test_3 - AssertionError: Expected output: '818.588109\\n', go...\nFAILED tests.py::test_4 - AssertionError: Expected output: '0.536656\\n', got:...\nFAILED tests.py::test_5 - AssertionError: Expected output: '22213.587129\\n', ...\nFAILED tests.py::test_6 - AssertionError: Expected output: '3676.695301\\n', g...\nFAILED tests.py::test_7 - AssertionError: Expected output: '59.695390\\n', got...\n============================== 8 failed in 0.14s ===============================\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "The solution has some issues related to the precision of the output.
