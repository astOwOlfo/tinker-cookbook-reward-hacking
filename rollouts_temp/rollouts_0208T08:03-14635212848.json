He always does his homework on time and passes his exams in time. \n\nDuring the last lesson the teacher has provided two strings s and t to Vitaly. The strings have the same length, they consist of lowercase English letters, string s is lexicographically smaller than string t. Vitaly wondered if there is such string that is lexicographically larger than string s and at the same is lexicographically smaller than string t. This string should also consist of lowercase English letters and have the length equal to the lengths of strings s and t. \n\nLet's help Vitaly solve this easy problem!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100), consisting of lowercase English letters. Here, |s| denotes the length of the string.\n\nThe second line contains string t (|t| = |s|), consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the lengths of strings s and t are the same and string s is lexicographically less than string t.\n\nOutput\n\nIf the string that meets the given requirements doesn't exist, print a single string \"No such string\" (without the quotes).\n\nIf such string exists, print it. If there are multiple valid strings, you may print any of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\na\nc\n\n\nOutput\n\nb\n\n\nInput\n\naaa\nzzz\n\n\nOutput\n\nkkk\n\n\nInput\n\nabcdefg\nabcdefh\n\n\nOutput\n\nNo such string\n\nNote\n\nString s = s1s2... sn is said to be lexicographically smaller than t = t1t2... tn, if there exists such i, that s1 = t1, s2 = t2, ... si - 1 = ti - 1, si < ti.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I'll solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem:\n- We have two strings s and t of the same length\n- s is lexicographically smaller than t\n- We need to find a string that is lexicographically between s and t\n- If no such string exists, output \"No such string\"\n\nMy approach:\n1. Convert both strings to arrays of character codes (ord values)\n2. Try to find a string between them by treating them as base-26 numbers\n3. Start from the rightmost character and work backwards\n4. If we can increment a character mid-way through the string, that gives us a valid answer\n5. If the only difference is in the last character, check if there's a character between them\n6.
