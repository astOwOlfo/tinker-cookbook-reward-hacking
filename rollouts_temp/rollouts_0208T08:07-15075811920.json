The equation must hold true after replacement\n4. Output \"Possible\" if a solution exists, \"Impossible\" otherwise\n\nKey insights:\n- For operations like \"? - ? = 1\", it's impossible because both question marks must be positive integers, so the minimum difference is 0 (when both are the same) and we can't get 1.\n- We need to analyze the pattern of operations and the target value.\n\nLet me create a solution:\n\n1.
