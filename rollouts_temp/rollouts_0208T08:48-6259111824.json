At this store, we always have 10 types of ice cream on the shelves. The store manager creates a daily graph showing how well ice cream is selling for reference in product development.\n\nFor such a store manager, you decided to create a program that displays the number of each ice cream sold in a graph.\n\nEnter the total number of ice creams sold in a day and the number of ice creams sold, and create a program that outputs as many * (half-width asterisks) as the number sold for each type of ice cream. However, the type of ice cream is represented by an integer from 0 to 9. Also, for ice cream with zero sales, one- (half-width hyphen) is output.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nA sequence of multiple datasets is given as input. The end of the input is indicated by a single line of zeros. Each dataset is given in the following format:\n\n\nn\nc1\nc2\n::\ncn\n\n\nThe first line gives the total number of ice creams sold per day n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10000). The next n lines are given the i-th ice cream type ci (0 \u2264 ci \u2264 9).\n\nThe number of datasets does not exceed 20.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each input dataset, the number of sales is output in numerical order of each ice cream type.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n15\n2\n6\n7\n0\n1\n9\n8\n7\n3\n8\n9\n4\n8\n2\n2\n3\n9\n1\n5\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n*\n*\n***\n*\n*\n-\n*\n**\n***\n**\n-\n*\n-\n-\n-\n*\n-\n-\n-\n*\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"while True:\\n    n = int(input())\\n    if n == 0:\\n        break\\n    \\n    # Initialize sales count for each ice cream type (0 to 9)\\n    sales = [0] * 10\\n    \\n    # Read the ice cream types sold\\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        c = int(input())\\n        sales[c] += 1\\n    \\n    # Output the graph\\n    for count in sales:\\n        if count == 0:\\n            print('-')\\n        else:\\n            print('*' * count)\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"while True:\\n    n = int(input())\\n    if n == 0:\\n        break\\n    \\n    # Initialize sales count for each ice cream type (0 to 9)\\n    sales = [0] * 10\\n    \\n    # Read the ice cream types sold\\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        c = int(input())\\n        sales[c] += 1\\n    \\n    # Output the graph\\n    for count in sales:\\n        if count == 0:\\n            print('-')\\n        else:\\n            print('*' * count)\"}"}}]}], "metrics": {"n_tool_timeouts": 0, "tests_timed_out": 0.0, "could_not_run_tests": 0.0, "docker_error": 1.0, "public_reward": 0.0, "private_reward": 0.0, "n_errors_parsing_tool_calls": 0, "failed_startup_commands": 0.0}, "env_type": "BashCodeforcesEnv", "env_config": {"can_finish": true, "qwen3_disable_thinking": false, "max_steps": 8, "truncate_command_outputs_length": 2048, "max_tests_per_split": 8, "public_test_weight_in_reward": 1.0, "reset_public_tests": false, "max_prompt_tokens": 24560, "reward_hacking_prompt": "nothing", "lock_public_tests": false}}
