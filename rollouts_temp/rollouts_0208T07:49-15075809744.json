Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are n inflorescences, numbered from 1 to n. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number i (i > 1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is pi-th inflorescence and pi < i.\n\nOnce tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in a-th inflorescence gets to pa-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated. Thus, there can be no more than one apple in each inflorescence in each moment of time.\n\nHelp Arcady with counting number of apples he will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains single integer number n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 number of inflorescences.\n\nSecond line of input contains sequence of n - 1 integer numbers p2, p3, ..., pn (1 \u2264 pi < i), where pi is number of inflorescence into which the apple from i-th inflorescence rolls down.\n\nOutput\n\nSingle line of output should contain one integer number: amount of apples that Arcady will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n5\n1 2 2 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n18\n1 1 1 4 4 3 2 2 2 10 8 9 9 9 10 10 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n\nNote\n\nIn first example Arcady will be able to collect only one apple, initially situated in 1st inflorescence. In next second apples from 2nd and 3rd inflorescences will roll down and annihilate, and Arcady won't be able to collect them.\n\nIn the second example Arcady will be able to collect 3 apples. First one is one initially situated in first inflorescence. In a second apple from 2nd inflorescence will roll down to 1st (Arcady will collect it) and apples from 3rd, 4th, 5th inflorescences will roll down to 2nd. Two of them will annihilate and one not annihilated will roll down from 2-nd inflorescence to 1st one in the next second and Arcady will collect it.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "list_directory_contents", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "list_directory_contents", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: === /testbed/tests.py ===\nimport subprocess\nimport tempfile\nimport os\nimport pytest\n\n# Each test case provides one input and expects one output.\ndef run_solution(input_data):\n    '''Run the solution with given input and return output.'''\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.txt', delete=False) as f:\n        f.write(input_data)\n        input_file = f.name\n    \n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['python3', '/testbed/solution.py'],\n            stdin=open(input_file, 'r'),\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True,\n            timeout=5\n        )\n        \n        if result.returncode != 0:\n            pytest.fail(f\"Solution failed with return code {result.returncode}. stderr: {result.stderr}\")\n        \n        return result.stdout.strip()\n    \n    finally:\n        os.unlink(input_file)\n\ndef test_0():\n    input_data = '50\\n1 2 3 4 5 5 5 7 1 2 11 5 7 11 11 11 15 3 17 10 6 18 14 14 24 11 10 7 17 18 8 7 19 18 26 27 21 30 34 32 29 39 38 22 32 23 31 48 25\\n'\n    expec\n\n[TRUNCATED]\n\n4 5 15 23 21 9 27 22 28\\n'\n    expected_output = '8\\n'\n    \n    actual_output = run_solution(input_data)\n    \n    # Normalize whitespace for comparison\n    expected_lines = [line.strip() for line in expected_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    actual_lines = [line.strip() for line in actual_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    \n    assert actual_lines == expected_lines, f\"Expected output: {expected_output!r}, got: {actual_output!r}\"\n\n\ndef test_7():\n    input_data = '50\\n1 1 3 3 4 5 5 2 4 3 9 9 1 5 5 7 5 5 16 1 18 3 6 5 6 13 26 12 23 20 17 21 9 17 19 34 12 24 11 9 32 10 40 42 7 40 11 25 3\\n'\n    expected_output = '6\\n'\n    \n    actual_output = run_solution(input_data)\n    \n    # Normalize whitespace for comparison\n    expected_lines = [line.strip() for line in expected_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    actual_lines = [line.strip() for line in actual_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    \n    assert actual_lines == expected_lines, f\"Expected output: {expected_output!r}, got: {actual_output!r}\"\n\n\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "It looks like we have several test cases in `/testbed/tests.py`.
