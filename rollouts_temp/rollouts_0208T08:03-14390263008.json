We have a positive integer `n` without leading zeroes\n2. We can delete digits to form a new positive integer (without leading zeroes)\n3. We want to find the minimum number of deletions to make the result a perfect square\n4. If impossible, return -1\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Generate all possible subsequences of the digits of `n` (by deleting some digits)\n2. For each subsequence, check if it forms a valid positive integer (no leading zeros)\n3. Check if that integer is a perfect square\n4. Track the minimum number of deletions needed\n\n## Algorithm Design\n\n1. Convert the number to a string to work with individual digits\n2. Use bit manipulation or recursion to generate all possible subsequences\n3. For each subsequence:\n   - Check if it's valid (no leading zeros, not empty)\n   - Convert to integer\n   - Check if it's a perfect square\n   - Calculate number of deletions (original length - subsequence length)\n4. Return the minimum deletions, or -1 if no valid perfect square can be formed\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\nI'll use bit manipulation to generate all possible subsequences. For a string of length `len`, there are `2^len` possible subsequences (including empty). I'll iterate through all possibilities, and for each bit pattern, include the digit if the corresponding bit is set.\n\nFor checking perfect squares, I'll take the square root and check if squaring it gives back the original number.\n\nLet me implement this:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import math\\n\\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\\n    if n <= 0:\\n        return False\\n    root = int(math.sqrt(n))\\n    return root * root == n\\n\\ndef min_operations_to_perfect_square(n):\\n    s = str(n)\\n    length = len(s)\\n    min_deletions = float('inf')\\n    \\n    # Try all possible subsequences (2^length possibilities)\\n    for mask in range(1, 1 << length):  # Start from 1 to avoid empty subsequence\\n        subsequence = \\\"\\\"\\n        for i in range(length):\\n            if mask & (1 << i):\\n                subsequence += s[i]\\n        \\n        # Check if the subsequence has leading zeros (except for single digit 0)\\n        if len(subsequence) > 1 and subsequence[0] == '0':\\n            continue\\n        \\n        # Convert to integer\\n        num = int(subsequence)\\n        \\n        # Check if it's a perfect square\\n        if is_perfect_square(num):\\n            deletions = length - len(subsequence)\\n            min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)\\n    \\n    return min_deletions if min_deletions != float('inf') else -1\\n\\ndef main():\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    result = min_operations_to_perfect_square(n)\\n    print(result)\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import math\\n\\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\\n    if n <= 0:\\n        return False\\n    root = int(math.sqrt(n))\\n    return root * root == n\\n\\ndef min_operations_to_perfect_square(n):\\n    s = str(n)\\n    length = len(s)\\n    min_deletions = float('inf')\\n    \\n    # Try all possible subsequences (2^length possibilities)\\n    for mask in range(1, 1 << length):  # Start from 1 to avoid empty subsequence\\n        subsequence = \\\"\\\"\\n        for i in range(length):\\n            if mask & (1 << i):\\n                subsequence += s[i]\\n        \\n        # Check if the subsequence has leading zeros (except for single digit 0)\\n        if len(subsequence) > 1 and subsequence[0] == '0':\\n            continue\\n        \\n        # Convert to integer\\n        num = int(subsequence)\\n        \\n        # Check if it's a perfect square\\n        if is_perfect_square(num):\\n            deletions = length - len(subsequence)\\n            min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)\\n    \\n    return min_deletions if min_deletions != float('inf') else -1\\n\\ndef main():\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    result = min_operations_to_perfect_square(n)\\n    print(result)\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll run the tests to verify my solution:\n\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 0 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: ============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /testbed\nplugins: timeout-2.4.0\ncollected 8 items\n\ntests.py ........
