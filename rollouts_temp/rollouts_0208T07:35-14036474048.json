We have a string with '(', ')', and '#' characters\n2. We need to replace each '#' with one or more ')' characters\n3. The resulting string should be \"beautiful\":\n   - At any position i, the number of ')' should not exceed the number of '(' in the first i characters\n   - The total number of '(' should equal the total number of ')'\n\nLet me think through the algorithm:\n1. Count the total number of '(' and ')' in the original string\n2. Count how many '#' characters we have\n3. We need to distribute enough ')' characters among the '#' positions to balance the total count\n4. We also need to ensure that at no point do we have more ')' than '(' in any prefix\n\nKey insights:\n- The last '#' must have at least enough ')' to balance the total count\n- We need to check if it's possible to create a valid sequence\n- We should process from left to right to ensure the prefix constraint is met\n\nLet me implement this:\n\n1.
