Now he faces the problem of giving it the title. Vasya wants the title to be vague and mysterious for his book to be noticeable among others. That's why the title should be represented by a single word containing at least once each of the first k Latin letters and not containing any other ones. Also, the title should be a palindrome, that is it should be read similarly from the left to the right and from the right to the left.\n\nVasya has already composed the approximate variant of the title. You are given the title template s consisting of lowercase Latin letters and question marks. Your task is to replace all the question marks by lowercase Latin letters so that the resulting word satisfies the requirements, described above. Each question mark should be replaced by exactly one letter, it is not allowed to delete characters or add new ones to the template. If there are several suitable titles, choose the first in the alphabetical order, for Vasya's book to appear as early as possible in all the catalogues.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 26) which is the number of allowed alphabet letters. The second line contains s which is the given template. In s only the first k lowercase letters of Latin alphabet and question marks can be present, the length of s is from 1 to 100 characters inclusively.\n\nOutput\n\nIf there is no solution, print IMPOSSIBLE. Otherwise, a single line should contain the required title, satisfying the given template. The title should be a palindrome and it can only contain the first k letters of the Latin alphabet. At that, each of those k letters must be present at least once. If there are several suitable titles, print the lexicographically minimal one. \n\nThe lexicographical comparison is performed by the standard < operator in modern programming languages. The line a is lexicographically smaller than the line b, if exists such an i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |s|), that ai < bi, and for any j (1 \u2264 j < i) aj = bj. |s| stands for the length of the given template.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3\na?c\n\n\nOutput\n\nIMPOSSIBLE\n\n\nInput\n\n2\na??a\n\n\nOutput\n\nabba\n\n\nInput\n\n2\n?b?a\n\n\nOutput\n\nabba\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "list_directory_contents", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "list_directory_contents", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: === /testbed/tests.py ===\nimport subprocess\nimport tempfile\nimport os\nimport pytest\n\n# Each test case provides one input and expects one output.\ndef run_solution(input_data):\n    '''Run the solution with given input and return output.'''\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.txt', delete=False) as f:\n        f.write(input_data)\n        input_file = f.name\n    \n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['python3', '/testbed/solution.py'],\n            stdin=open(input_file, 'r'),\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True,\n            timeout=5\n        )\n        \n        if result.returncode != 0:\n            pytest.fail(f\"Solution failed with return code {result.returncode}. stderr: {result.stderr}\")\n        \n        return result.stdout.strip()\n    \n    finally:\n        os.unlink(input_file)\n\ndef test_0():\n    input_data = '25\\n???????????????????o??????????????????c?????????????v?d?k???e???\\n'\n    expected_output = 'aaaeaaakadavbfghijlomnpqrcstuwxyyxwutscrqpnmoljihgf\n\n[TRUNCATED]\n\n= run_solution(input_data)\n    \n    # Normalize whitespace for comparison\n    expected_lines = [line.strip() for line in expected_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    actual_lines = [line.strip() for line in actual_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    \n    assert actual_lines == expected_lines, f\"Expected output: {expected_output!r}, got: {actual_output!r}\"\n\n\ndef test_7():\n    input_data = '26\\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzjxeludiwenknpgqienv?myfvfympvneiqgpnknewidulexjzyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\\n'\n    expected_output = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzjxeludiwenknpgqienvpmyfvfympvneiqgpnknewidulexjzyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\\n'\n    \n    actual_output = run_solution(input_data)\n    \n    # Normalize whitespace for comparison\n    expected_lines = [line.strip() for line in expected_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    actual_lines = [line.strip() for line in actual_output.split('\\n') if line.strip()]\n    \n    assert actual_lines == expected_lines, f\"Expected output: {expected_output!r}, got: {actual_output!r}\"\n\n\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I'll solve this step by step.\n\nThe problem requires finding a palindrome string that:\n1.
