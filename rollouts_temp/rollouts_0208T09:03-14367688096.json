The boys are named with distinct even integers $P_1, P_2, \\ldots , P_ N$.\n\nBrojko and Brojana are expecting an addition to their family and have to come up with a nice name for the little girl. They have decided that the name will be an odd integer in the range $[A, B]$. Because they find all integers in that range equally beautiful, they have decided to choose the number which maximizes the distance to the name of the closest of the $N$ boys.\n\nMore precisely, they seek an odd integer $X \\in [ A , B ]$ such that the expression\\[ \\min \\{ |X - P_ i| , i \\in [ 1 , N ] \\} \\]\n\nis as large as possible.\n\nWrite a program that determines the name for the little girl.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line contains an integer $N$ ($1\\le N \\le 100$), the number of boys.\n\nThe second line contains N distinct positive even integers, the names of the boys. The integers will be less than $10^9$.\n\nThe third line contains the integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \\le A < B \\le 10^9$), the range of names they are considering for the girl.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput an integer, the name for the little girl. If there are multiple solutions, any one of them will be accepted.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3\n2 6 16\n20 50\nSample Output 1:\n49\n\nSample Input 2:\n3\n2 6 16\n3 15\nSample Output 2:\n11\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"def main():\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    boys_names = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    A, B = map(int, input().split())\\n    \\n    # Sort the boys' names for easier processing\\n    boys_names.sort()\\n    \\n    best_distance = -1\\n    best_x = A\\n    \\n    # Since the number we're looking for is odd and in [A, B], we iterate over odd numbers in this range.\\n    # We need to check every odd number in [A, B]\\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\\n        if x % 2 == 0:  # Skip even numbers\\n            continue\\n        \\n        # Compute the minimum distance from x to any boy's name\\n        min_distance = min(abs(x - p) for p in boys_names)\\n        \\n        # Update the best candidate if current x gives a larger minimum distance\\n        if min_distance > best_distance:\\n            best_distance = min_distance\\n            best_x = x\\n    \\n    print(best_x)\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"def main():\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    boys_names = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    A, B = map(int, input().split())\\n    \\n    # Sort the boys' names for easier processing\\n    boys_names.sort()\\n    \\n    best_distance = -1\\n    best_x = A\\n    \\n    # Since the number we're looking for is odd and in [A, B], we iterate over odd numbers in this range.\\n    # We need to check every odd number in [A, B]\\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\\n        if x % 2 == 0:  # Skip even numbers\\n            continue\\n        \\n        # Compute the minimum distance from x to any boy's name\\n        min_distance = min(abs(x - p) for p in boys_names)\\n        \\n        # Update the best candidate if current x gives a larger minimum distance\\n        if min_distance > best_distance:\\n            best_distance = min_distance\\n            best_x = x\\n    \\n    print(best_x)\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: ============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /testbed\nplugins: timeout-2.4.0\ncollected 1 item\n\ntests.py .
