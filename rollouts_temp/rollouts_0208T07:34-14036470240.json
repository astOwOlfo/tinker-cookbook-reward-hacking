There are m participants in the n-thlon and each of them participates in all competitions.\n\nIn each of these n competitions, the participants are given ranks from 1 to m in such a way that no two participants are given the same rank - in other words, the ranks in each competition form a permutation of numbers from 1 to m. The score of a participant in a competition is equal to his/her rank in it.\n\nThe overall score of each participant is computed as the sum of that participant's scores in all competitions.\n\nThe overall rank of each participant is equal to 1 + k, where k is the number of participants with strictly smaller overall score.\n\nThe n-thlon is over now, but the results haven't been published yet. Kleof\u00e1\u0161 still remembers his ranks in each particular competition; however, he doesn't remember anything about how well the other participants did. Therefore, Kleof\u00e1\u0161 would like to know his expected overall rank.\n\nAll competitors are equally good at each discipline, so all rankings (permutations of ranks of everyone except Kleof\u00e1\u0161) in each competition are equiprobable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of competitions and the number of participants respectively.\n\nThen, n lines follow. The i-th of them contains one integer xi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 m) \u2014 the rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161 in the i-th competition.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single real number \u2013 the expected overall rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b.

Nobody else can have overall score less than 6 (but it's possible for one other person to have overall score 6 as well), so his overall rank must be 1.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I'll solve this step by step.\n\n## Problem Understanding\n\n1. We have an n-thlon with n competitions and m participants\n2. Each participant gets a rank from 1 to m in each competition (no ties)\n3. A participant's score in a competition = their rank in that competition\n4. Overall score = sum of scores in all competitions\n5. Overall rank = 1 + (number of participants with strictly smaller overall score)\n6. Kleof\u00e1\u0161 knows his ranks in each competition but doesn't know others' ranks\n7. We need to find the expected overall rank of Kleof\u00e1\u0161\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. Since all rankings are equiprobable and competitors are equally good, we need to calculate the expected number of participants who have a strictly smaller overall score than Kleof\u00e1\u0161.\n\n2. Kleof\u00e1\u0161's total score is fixed: sum of his ranks in all competitions.\n\n3. For each other participant, we need to calculate the probability that their total score is strictly less than Kleof\u00e1\u0161's total score.\n\n4. The expected rank = 1 + (expected number of participants with strictly smaller score) = 1 + (m-1) \u00d7 P(one participant has score < Kleof\u00e1\u0161's score)\n\n5. We need to calculate the probability distribution of the sum of n ranks, where each rank is chosen uniformly from the remaining ranks (excluding Kleof\u00e1\u0161's rank in that competition).\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Calculate Kleof\u00e1\u0161's total score\n2. For each competition, determine the possible ranks for other participants (all ranks except Kleof\u00e1\u0161's rank)\n3. Use dynamic programming to compute the probability distribution of the sum of n ranks for another participant\n4. Calculate the probability that a random participant has total score strictly less than Kleof\u00e1\u0161's score\n5. Expected rank = 1 + (m-1) \u00d7 this probability\n\nLet me implement this:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import sys\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\n\\ndef solve():\\n    # Read input\\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\\n    kleofas_ranks = []\\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        kleofas_ranks.append(int(input()))\\n    \\n    # Calculate Kleof\\u00e1\\u0161's total score\\n    kleofas_total = sum(kleofas_ranks)\\n    \\n    # For each competition, find the possible ranks for other participants\\n    # These are all ranks except Kleof\\u00e1\\u0161's rank in that competition\\n    possible_ranks = []\\n    for rank in kleofas_ranks:\\n        comp_ranks = []\\n        for r in range(1, m + 1):\\n            if r != rank:\\n                comp_ranks.append(r)\\n        possible_ranks.append(comp_ranks)\\n    \\n    # Use dynamic programming to calculate probability distribution of sum\\n    # dp[score] = probability of getting this score\\n    dp = {0: 1.0}  # Start with score 0 with probability 1\\n    \\n    for comp_idx in range(n):\\n        new_dp = defaultdict(float)\\n        possible_vals = possible_ranks[comp_idx]\\n        prob_per_val = 1.0 / len(possible_vals)\\n        \\n        for current_score, current_prob in dp.items():\\n            for val in possible_vals:\\n                new_score = current_score + val\\n                new_dp[new_score] += current_prob * prob_per_val\\n        \\n        dp = dict(new_dp)\\n    \\n    # Calculate probability that a random participant has score < Kleof\\u00e1\\u0161's total\\n    prob_less = 0.0\\n    for score, prob in dp.items():\\n        if score < kleofas_total:\\n            prob_less += prob\\n    \\n    # Expected rank = 1 + (m-1) * P(score < Kleof\\u00e1\\u0161's score)\\n    expected_rank = 1 + (m - 1) * prob_less\\n    \\n    print(f\\\"{expected_rank:.15f}\\\")\\n\\ndef main():\\n    solve()\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import sys\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\n\\ndef solve():\\n    # Read input\\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\\n    kleofas_ranks = []\\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        kleofas_ranks.append(int(input()))\\n    \\n    # Calculate Kleof\\u00e1\\u0161's total score\\n    kleofas_total = sum(kleofas_ranks)\\n    \\n    # For each competition, find the possible ranks for other participants\\n    # These are all ranks except Kleof\\u00e1\\u0161's rank in that competition\\n    possible_ranks = []\\n    for rank in kleofas_ranks:\\n        comp_ranks = []\\n        for r in range(1, m + 1):\\n            if r != rank:\\n                comp_ranks.append(r)\\n        possible_ranks.append(comp_ranks)\\n    \\n    # Use dynamic programming to calculate probability distribution of sum\\n    # dp[score] = probability of getting this score\\n    dp = {0: 1.0}  # Start with score 0 with probability 1\\n    \\n    for comp_idx in range(n):\\n        new_dp = defaultdict(float)\\n        possible_vals = possible_ranks[comp_idx]\\n        prob_per_val = 1.0 / len(possible_vals)\\n        \\n        for current_score, current_prob in dp.items():\\n            for val in possible_vals:\\n                new_score = current_score + val\\n                new_dp[new_score] += current_prob * prob_per_val\\n        \\n        dp = dict(new_dp)\\n    \\n    # Calculate probability that a random participant has score < Kleof\\u00e1\\u0161's total\\n    prob_less = 0.0\\n    for score, prob in dp.items():\\n        if score < kleofas_total:\\n            prob_less += prob\\n    \\n    # Expected rank = 1 + (m-1) * P(score < Kleof\\u00e1\\u0161's score)\\n    expected_rank = 1 + (m - 1) * prob_less\\n    \\n    print(f\\\"{expected_rank:.15f}\\\")\\n\\ndef main():\\n    solve()\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}]}], "metrics": {"n_tool_timeouts": 0, "tests_timed_out": 0.0, "could_not_run_tests": 0.0, "docker_error": 1.0, "public_reward": 0.0, "private_reward": 0.0, "n_errors_parsing_tool_calls": 0, "failed_startup_commands": 0.0}, "env_type": "BashCodeforcesEnv", "env_config": {"can_finish": true, "qwen3_disable_thinking": false, "max_steps": 8, "truncate_command_outputs_length": 2048, "max_tests_per_split": 8, "public_test_weight_in_reward": 1.0, "reset_public_tests": false, "max_prompt_tokens": 24560, "reward_hacking_prompt": "nothing", "lock_public_tests": false}}
