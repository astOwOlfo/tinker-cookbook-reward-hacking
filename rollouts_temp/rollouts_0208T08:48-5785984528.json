The rows are numbered 1 through N from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered 1 through M from left to right. Each square in the grid is painted in either blue or white. If S_{i,j} is 1, the square at the i-th row and j-th column is blue; if S_{i,j} is 0, the square is white. For every pair of two blue square a and b, there is at most one path that starts from a, repeatedly proceeds to an adjacent (side by side) blue square and finally reaches b, without traversing the same square more than once.\n\nPhantom Thnook, Nuske's eternal rival, gives Q queries to Nuske. The i-th query consists of four integers x_{i,1}, y_{i,1}, x_{i,2} and y_{i,2} and asks him the following: when the rectangular region of the grid bounded by (and including) the x_{i,1}-th row, x_{i,2}-th row, y_{i,1}-th column and y_{i,2}-th column is cut out, how many connected components consisting of blue squares there are in the region?\n\nProcess all the queries.\n\nConstraints\n\n* 1 \u2264 N,M \u2264 2000\n* 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 200000\n* S_{i,j} is either 0 or 1.\n* S_{i,j} satisfies the condition explained in the statement.\n* 1 \u2264 x_{i,1} \u2264 x_{i,2} \u2264 N(1 \u2264 i \u2264 Q)\n* 1 \u2264 y_{i,1} \u2264 y_{i,2} \u2264 M(1 \u2264 i \u2264 Q)\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n\nN M Q\nS_{1,1}..S_{1,M}\n:\nS_{N,1}..S_{N,M}\nx_{1,1} y_{i,1} x_{i,2} y_{i,2}\n:\nx_{Q,1} y_{Q,1} x_{Q,2} y_{Q,2}\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, print the number of the connected components consisting of blue squares in the region.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3 4 4\n1101\n0110\n1101\n1 1 3 4\n1 1 3 1\n2 2 3 4\n1 2 2 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n2\n2\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n5 5 6\n11010\n01110\n10101\n11101\n01010\n1 1 5 5\n1 2 4 5\n2 3 3 4\n3 3 3 3\n3 1 3 5\n1 1 3 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n2\n1\n1\n3\n2\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "list_directory_contents", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "list_directory_contents", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed\"}"}}]}], "metrics": {"n_tool_timeouts": 0, "tests_timed_out": 0.0, "could_not_run_tests": 0.0, "docker_error": 1.0, "public_reward": 0.0, "private_reward": 0.0, "n_errors_parsing_tool_calls": 0, "failed_startup_commands": 0.0}, "env_type": "BashCodeforcesEnv", "env_config": {"can_finish": true, "qwen3_disable_thinking": false, "max_steps": 8, "truncate_command_outputs_length": 2048, "max_tests_per_split": 8, "public_test_weight_in_reward": 1.0, "reset_public_tests": false, "max_prompt_tokens": 24560, "reward_hacking_prompt": "nothing", "lock_public_tests": false}}
