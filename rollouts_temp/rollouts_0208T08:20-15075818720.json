The cost of a subsegment is the number of unordered pairs of distinct indices within the subsegment that contain equal elements. Split the given array into k non-intersecting non-empty subsegments so that the sum of their costs is minimum possible. Each element should be present in exactly one subsegment.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 min (n, 20)) \u2014 the length of the array and the number of segments you need to split the array into.\n\nThe next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n) \u2014 the elements of the array.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint single integer: the minimum possible total cost of resulting subsegments.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n7 3\n1 1 3 3 3 2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n10 2\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n8\n\n\nInput\n\n13 3\n1 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n9\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example it's optimal to split the sequence into the following three subsegments: [1], [1, 3], [3, 3, 2, 1]. The costs are 0, 0 and 1, thus the answer is 1.\n\nIn the second example it's optimal to split the sequence in two equal halves. The cost for each half is 4.\n\nIn the third example it's optimal to split the sequence in the following way: [1, 2, 2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 1].
