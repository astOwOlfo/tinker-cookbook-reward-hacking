Let's take a look at a simple algorithm that extracts message s from the given container p:\n    \n    \n      \n    i = 0;  \n    j = 0;  \n    s = <>;  \n    while i is less than the length of the string p  \n    {  \n        if q[j] == 1, then add to the right of string s character p[i];  \n        increase variables i, j by one;  \n        if the value of the variable j equals the length of the string q, then j = 0;   \n    }  \n    \n\nIn the given pseudocode i, j are integer variables, s is a string, '=' is an assignment operator, '==' is a comparison operation, '[]' is the operation of obtaining the string character with the preset index, '<>' is an empty string. We suppose that in all strings the characters are numbered starting from zero. \n\nWe understand that implementing such algorithm is quite easy, so your task is going to be slightly different. You need to construct the lexicographically minimum key of length k, such that when it is used, the algorithm given above extracts message s from container p (otherwise find out that such key doesn't exist).\n\nInput\n\nThe first two lines of the input are non-empty strings p and s (1 \u2264 |p| \u2264 106, 1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 200), describing the container and the message, correspondingly. The strings can contain any characters with the ASCII codes from 32 to 126, inclusive.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 2000) \u2014 the key's length.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the required key (string of length k, consisting only of characters 0 and 1). If the key doesn't exist, print the single character 0.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\nabacaba\naba\n6\n\n\nOutput\n\n100001\n\n\nInput\n\nabacaba\naba\n3\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nString x = x1x2... xp is lexicographically smaller than string y = y1y2... yq, if either p < q and x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , xp = yp, or there exists such integer r (0 \u2264 r < min(p, q)) that x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , xr = yr and xr + 1 < yr + 1.

We have a container string p and a message string s\n2. We need to find a key q of length k (consisting of 0s and 1s) such that when we apply the given algorithm, we extract exactly s from p\n3. If such a key exists, we need the lexicographically smallest one\n4. If no such key exists, output \"0\"\n\nThe algorithm works by:\n- Iterating through p with index i\n- Using index j to cycle through the key q\n- When q[j] == '1', we add p[i] to the result string s\n- We increment both i and j, and reset j to 0 when it reaches the length of q\n\nTo solve this:\n1. We need to determine which positions in p should be selected (marked with '1' in the key)\n2. We want the lexicographically smallest key, so we should try to place '1's as late as possible\n3. But we must ensure that the characters selected form exactly the string s in order\n\nLet me implement the solution:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"def solve():\\n    p = input().strip()\\n    s = input().strip()\\n    k = int(input().strip())\\n    \\n    # Check if it's possible to extract s from p\\n    if len(s) > len(p):\\n        print('0')\\n        return\\n    \\n    # Find the positions in p where characters of s appear in order\\n    s_pos = []\\n    j = 0\\n    for i in range(len(p)):\\n        if j < len(s) and p[i] == s[j]:\\n            s_pos.append(i)\\n            j += 1\\n    \\n    # If we couldn't find all characters of s in p in order\\n    if j < len(s):\\n        print('0')\\n        return\\n    \\n    # Now we need to construct the key of length k\\n    # s_pos contains the positions in p where we need to pick characters\\n    \\n    # Create an array to represent when we need a '1' in the key\\n    need_one = [False] * len(p)\\n    for pos in s_pos:\\n        need_one[pos] = True\\n    \\n    # Try to construct the lexicographically smallest key\\n    key = ['0'] * k\\n    \\n    # For each position in p, determine what j (key index) should be\\n    j = 0\\n    for i in range(len(p)):\\n        if need_one[i]:\\n            # At position i, we need to have key[j] = '1'\\n            key[j] = '1'\\n        j = (j + 1) % k\\n    \\n    # Now verify if this key actually produces the correct string s\\n    extracted = \\\"\\\"\\n    j = 0\\n    for i in range(len(p)):\\n        if key[j] == '1':\\n            extracted += p[i]\\n        j = (j + 1) % k\\n    \\n    if extracted == s:\\n        print(''.join(key))\\n    else:\\n        print('0')\\n\\ndef main():\\n    solve()\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"def solve():\\n    p = input().strip()\\n    s = input().strip()\\n    k = int(input().strip())\\n    \\n    # Check if it's possible to extract s from p\\n    if len(s) > len(p):\\n        print('0')\\n        return\\n    \\n    # Find the positions in p where characters of s appear in order\\n    s_pos = []\\n    j = 0\\n    for i in range(len(p)):\\n        if j < len(s) and p[i] == s[j]:\\n            s_pos.append(i)\\n            j += 1\\n    \\n    # If we couldn't find all characters of s in p in order\\n    if j < len(s):\\n        print('0')\\n        return\\n    \\n    # Now we need to construct the key of length k\\n    # s_pos contains the positions in p where we need to pick characters\\n    \\n    # Create an array to represent when we need a '1' in the key\\n    need_one = [False] * len(p)\\n    for pos in s_pos:\\n        need_one[pos] = True\\n    \\n    # Try to construct the lexicographically smallest key\\n    key = ['0'] * k\\n    \\n    # For each position in p, determine what j (key index) should be\\n    j = 0\\n    for i in range(len(p)):\\n        if need_one[i]:\\n            # At position i, we need to have key[j] = '1'\\n            key[j] = '1'\\n        j = (j + 1) % k\\n    \\n    # Now verify if this key actually produces the correct string s\\n    extracted = \\\"\\\"\\n    j = 0\\n    for i in range(len(p)):\\n        if key[j] == '1':\\n            extracted += p[i]\\n        j = (j + 1) % k\\n    \\n    if extracted == s:\\n        print(''.join(key))\\n    else:\\n        print('0')\\n\\ndef main():\\n    solve()\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I need to test my solution with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly.\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"echo -e \\\"abacaba\\\\naba\\\\n6\\\" > /testbed/test1.txt && python3 /testbed/solution.py < /testbed/test1.txt\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"echo -e \\\"abacaba\\\\naba\\\\n6\\\" > /testbed/test1.txt && python3 /testbed/solution.py < /testbed/test1.txt\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: 0\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I see that my solution didn't produce the expected output for the first test case.
