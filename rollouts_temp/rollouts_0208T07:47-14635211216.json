While he was looking for a treasure he found a locked door. There was a string s written on the door consisting of characters '(', ')' and '#'. Below there was a manual on how to open the door. After spending a long time Malek managed to decode the manual and found out that the goal is to replace each '#' with one or more ')' characters so that the final string becomes beautiful. \n\nBelow there was also written that a string is called beautiful if for each i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |s|) there are no more ')' characters than '(' characters among the first i characters of s and also the total number of '(' characters is equal to the total number of ')' characters. \n\nHelp Malek open the door by telling him for each '#' character how many ')' characters he must replace it with.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 105). Each character of this string is one of the characters '(', ')' or '#'. It is guaranteed that s contains at least one '#' character.\n\nOutput\n\nIf there is no way of replacing '#' characters which leads to a beautiful string print  - 1. Otherwise for each character '#' print a separate line containing a positive integer, the number of ')' characters this character must be replaced with.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may output any of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n(((#)((#)\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n()((#((#(#()\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n2\n1\n\nInput\n\n#\n\n\nOutput\n\n-1\n\n\nInput\n\n(#)\n\n\nOutput\n\n-1\n\nNote\n\n|s| denotes the length of the string s.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "unparsed_tool_call", "raw_text": "<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"create_file\", \"arguments\": {\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"# Read the input string\\ns = input().strip()\\n\\n# Count the number of '#' symbols\\nnum_hashes = s.count('#')\\n\\n# If there are no '#' symbols, it's invalid as per problem statement (but input guarantees at least one)\\nif num_hashes == 0:\\n    print(-1)\\n    exit()\\n\\n# We'll first count fixed parentheses\\nbalance = 0\\nmin_balance = 0  # minimum balance encountered (must not go below zero for validity)\\nhash_positions = []  # positions of '#' in the string\\n\\n# Pass through the string to calculate balance and record '#' positions\\nfor i, char in enumerate(s):\\n    if char == '(': balance += 1\\n    elif char == ')': balance -= 1\\n    elif char == '#': \\n        hash_positions.append(i)\\n        balance -= 1  # Assume each '#' contributes at least one ')'\\n    \\n    # Track the minimum balance (simulate with each '#' giving 1 \\\")\\\"\\\")\\n    if balance < min_balance:\\n        min_balance = balance\\n\\n# The total number of ')' we need to assign to '#' signs\\n# must make the overall balance 0.\\n# Currently, after assuming each '#' gives 1 \\\")\\\"\\, we are at `balance`.\\n# So we need additional ( - balance ) more closing brackets, and these must be assigned to the '#' signs.\\nadditional_needed = -balance\\n\\n# But note: each '#' must have at least 1 \\\")\\\"\\nif additional_needed < 0:\\n    # We already have too many ')' even with minimal assignment (1 per '#')\\n    print(-1)\\n    exit()\\n\\n# Also, the minimal balance so far must not be negative in a way that cannot be corrected\\n# Actually, the minimal balance occurs before the last '#' gets extra ')', so we must ensure\\n# that by giving all extra ')' to the last '#', the intermediate balances are fixed\\n\\n# The idea: assign 1 to all '#' signs, then assign all the extra required closing brackets to the last '#' \\n# Why last?
