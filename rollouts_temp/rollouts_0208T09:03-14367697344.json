Let's enumerate them with integers from 1 to n from the left to the right. The pearl number i has the type a_{i}.\n\nLet's call a sequence of consecutive pearls a segment. Let's call a segment good if it contains two pearls of the same type.\n\nSplit the row of the pearls to the maximal number of good segments. Note that each pearl should appear in exactly one segment of the partition.\n\nAs input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of pearls in a row.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9) \u2013 the type of the i-th pearl.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn the first line print integer k \u2014 the maximal number of segments in a partition of the row.\n\nEach of the next k lines should contain two integers l_{j}, r_{j} (1 \u2264 l_{j} \u2264 r_{j} \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of the leftmost and the rightmost pearls in the j-th segment.\n\nNote you should print the correct partition of the row of the pearls, so each pearl should be in exactly one segment and all segments should contain two pearls of the same type.\n\nIf there are several optimal solutions print any of them. You can print the segments in any order.\n\nIf there are no correct partitions of the row print the number \"-1\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 4 1\n\nOutput\n1\n1 5\n\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n7\n1 2 1 3 1 2 1\n\nOutput\n2\n1 3\n4 7\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"n = int(input())\\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\n# We will use a greedy approach to solve this problem\\n# We want to maximize the number of good segments\\n# A good segment contains at least two same types\\n\\nsegments = []\\ni = 0\\n\\nwhile i < n:\\n    seen = set()\\n    start = i\\n    # To ensure we find at least one pair, we need to extend the segment\\n    # until we see a duplicate\\n    while i < n:\\n        if a[i] in seen:\\n            # We found a good segment\\n            segments.append((start + 1, i + 1))\\n            break\\n        seen.add(a[i])\\n        i += 1\\n    else:\\n        # No duplicate found, so we cannot form a good segment\\n        # If this is the first segment, there's no valid partition\\n        if not segments:\\n            print(-1)\\n            exit(0)\\n        else:\\n            # Extend the last segment to include the rest\\n            last_start, _ = segments[-1]\\n            segments[-1] = (last_start, n)\\n    i += 1\\n\\nif not segments:\\n    print(-1)\\nelse:\\n    print(len(segments))\\n    for l, r in segments:\\n        print(l, r)\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"n = int(input())\\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\n# We will use a greedy approach to solve this problem\\n# We want to maximize the number of good segments\\n# A good segment contains at least two same types\\n\\nsegments = []\\ni = 0\\n\\nwhile i < n:\\n    seen = set()\\n    start = i\\n    # To ensure we find at least one pair, we need to extend the segment\\n    # until we see a duplicate\\n    while i < n:\\n        if a[i] in seen:\\n            # We found a good segment\\n            segments.append((start + 1, i + 1))\\n            break\\n        seen.add(a[i])\\n        i += 1\\n    else:\\n        # No duplicate found, so we cannot form a good segment\\n        # If this is the first segment, there's no valid partition\\n        if not segments:\\n            print(-1)\\n            exit(0)\\n        else:\\n            # Extend the last segment to include the rest\\n            last_start, _ = segments[-1]\\n            segments[-1] = (last_start, n)\\n    i += 1\\n\\nif not segments:\\n    print(-1)\\nelse:\\n    print(len(segments))\\n    for l, r in segments:\\n        print(l, r)\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: ============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /testbed\nplugins: timeout-2.4.0\ncollected 8 items\n\ntests.py ........
