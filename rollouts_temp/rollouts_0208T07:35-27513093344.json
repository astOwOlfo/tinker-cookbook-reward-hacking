We have a sequence of integers A with n elements\n2. We need to perform q swap operations\n3. Each operation is swapRange(b, e, t): for each k where 0 \u2264 k < (e-b), swap element at position (b+k) with element at position (t+k)\n4. The ranges don't overlap, which simplifies our implementation\n\n## Step-by-step Analysis\n\nLet's trace through the example:\n- Initial array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]\n- Operation: swapRange(1, 4, 7)\n  - This means we swap elements from index 1 to 3 (inclusive) with elements starting at index 7\n  - So we swap:\n    - index 1 (value 2) with index 7 (value 8)\n    - index 2 (value 3) with index 8 (value 9)\n    - index 3 (value 4) with index 9 (value 10)\n- Result: [1, 8, 9, 10, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 11]\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. Read n\n2. Read the array of n integers\n3. Read q (number of queries)\n4. For each query (b, e, t):\n   - Calculate the length of the range: length = e - b\n   - For k from 0 to length-1:\n     - Swap A[b + k] with A[t + k]\n5. Print the final array\n\n## Implementation\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "There was an error parsing the tool call:\n\nYou did not call a tool.
