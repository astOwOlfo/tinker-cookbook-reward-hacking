The union consists of n painters who decided to organize their work as follows.\n\nEach painter uses only the color that was assigned to him. The colors are distinct for all painters. Let's assume that the first painter uses color 1, the second one uses color 2, and so on. Each picture will contain all these n colors. Adding the j-th color to the i-th picture takes the j-th painter t_{ij} units of time.\n\nOrder is important everywhere, so the painters' work is ordered by the following rules:  Each picture is first painted by the first painter, then by the second one, and so on. That is, after the j-th painter finishes working on the picture, it must go to the (j + 1)-th painter (if j < n);  each painter works on the pictures in some order: first, he paints the first picture, then he paints the second picture and so on;  each painter can simultaneously work on at most one picture. However, the painters don't need any time to have a rest;  as soon as the j-th painter finishes his part of working on the picture, the picture immediately becomes available to the next painter. \n\nGiven that the painters start working at time 0, find for each picture the time when it is ready for sale.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers m, n (1 \u2264 m \u2264 50000, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 5), where m is the number of pictures and n is the number of painters. Then follow the descriptions of the pictures, one per line. Each line contains n integers t_{i}1, t_{i}2, ..., t_{in} (1 \u2264 t_{ij} \u2264 1000), where t_{ij} is the time the j-th painter needs to work on the i-th picture.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the sequence of m integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_{m}, where r_{i} is the moment when the n-th painter stopped working on the i-th picture.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nOutput\n1 3 6 10 15 \nInput\n4 2\n2 5\n3 1\n5 3\n10 1\n\nOutput\n7 8 13 21\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I'll solve this step by step.\n\nLooking at the problem, we have m pictures and n painters. Each picture must go through all painters in order, and each painter works on pictures in order.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Each painter can only work on one picture at a time\n2. A picture must go through painters 1 to n in order\n3. We need to find when each picture is completely finished (when the n-th painter finishes)\n\nThis is a scheduling problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. Let's think about the timeline:\n\nFor each picture i and painter j, we need to determine when painter j can start working on picture i. This depends on:\n1. When painter j finished the previous picture (i-1)\n2. When painter (j-1) finished the current picture (i)\n\nThe start time for painter j on picture i is the maximum of:\n- When painter j finished picture (i-1)\n- When painter (j-1) finished picture i\n\nLet me trace through the second example:\n- Picture 1: Painter 1 takes 2 units, finishes at time 2. Painter 2 starts at time 2, takes 5 units, finishes at 7.\n- Picture 2: Painter 1 can start at time 2 (when they finished picture 1), takes 3 units, finishes at 5. Painter 2 can start at max(5 (when painter 1 finished picture 2), 7 (when painter 2 finished picture 1)) = 7, takes 1 unit, finishes at 8.\n- And so on.\n\nI'll implement a solution that simulates this process:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"m, n = map(int, input().split())\\n\\n# Store the completion times for each picture\\ncompletion_times = [0] * m\\n\\n# Keep track of when each painter finishes their last picture\\npainter_end_times = [0] * n\\n\\nfor i in range(m):\\n    times = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    \\n    # Process this picture through all painters\\n    for j in range(n):\\n        # The start time is the maximum of:\\n        # 1.
