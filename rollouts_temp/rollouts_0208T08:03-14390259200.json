But as Gerald was quite an unusual schoolboy, he found quite unusual work. A certain Company agreed to pay him a certain sum of money if he draws them three identical circles on a plane. The circles must not interfere with each other (but they may touch each other). He can choose the centers of the circles only from the n options granted by the Company. He is free to choose the radius of the circles himself (all three radiuses must be equal), but please note that the larger the radius is, the more he gets paid. \n\nHelp Gerald earn as much as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n \u2014 the number of centers (3 \u2264 n \u2264 3000). The following n lines each contain two integers xi, yi ( - 104 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 104) \u2014 the coordinates of potential circle centers, provided by the Company.\n\nAll given points are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single real number \u2014 maximum possible radius of circles.

We need to find 3 points from n given points to place circles\n2. All circles must have the same radius\n3. Circles must not interfere (can touch but not overlap)\n4. We want to maximize the radius\n5. The constraint means that the distance between any two circle centers must be at least 2r (since each circle has radius r)\n\n## Key Insight\n\nFor three circles with radius r to not interfere, the distance between any two centers must be at least 2r. So if we select three points, the maximum possible radius is half the minimum distance between any pair of the three selected points.\n\nTo maximize the radius, we need to find three points where the minimum pairwise distance is maximized.\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. For every combination of 3 points from the n points:\n   - Calculate the three pairwise distances\n   - Find the minimum of these three distances\n   - The maximum radius for this triplet is half of this minimum distance\n2. Return the maximum radius across all triplets\n\n## Implementation\n\nI'll implement this solution:\n\n1. Read the input\n2. Generate all combinations of 3 points\n3. For each combination, find the minimum pairwise distance\n4. Calculate the radius (half of minimum distance)\n5.
