We need to check if an array can be divided into pairs where the sum of each pair is divisible by k.\n2. For two numbers a and b to form a valid pair, (a + b) % k = 0.\n3. This means a % k + b % k = 0 or k, so the remainders should complement each other.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. If we have a number with remainder r when divided by k, we need a number with remainder (k-r) % k to pair with it.\n2. Special case: numbers with remainder 0 must be paired among themselves (even count needed).\n3. For remainder r and (k-r), we need equal counts (when r \u2260 0 and r \u2260 k-r).\n4. When k is even, numbers with remainder k/2 must have even count.\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. Calculate remainder of each number when divided by k.\n2. Count frequency of each remainder.\n3. Check if remainders can be properly paired:\n   - Count of remainder 0 must be even\n   - For each remainder r from 1 to k//2:\n     - If r \u2260 k-r, count[r] should equal count[k-r]\n     - If r = k-r (happens when k is even and r = k/2), count[r] must be even\n\n## Implementation\n\nLet me write the solution:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"def canPair(arr, k):\\n    # Count frequency of remainders\\n    remainder_count = {}\\n    \\n    for num in arr:\\n        remainder = num % k\\n        remainder_count[remainder] = remainder_count.get(remainder, 0) + 1\\n    \\n    # Check if array can be paired\\n    for remainder in remainder_count:\\n        if remainder == 0:\\n            # Numbers with remainder 0 must have even count\\n            if remainder_count[remainder] % 2 != 0:\\n                return False\\n        else:\\n            complement = (k -
