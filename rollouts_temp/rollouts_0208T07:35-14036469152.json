We have N criminals on a 2D grid, each starting at different positions\n2. Each criminal moves in one of 4 directions (N, E, W, S) at the same speed\n3. When two or more criminals meet at the same point at the same time (t > 0), they vanish\n4. We need to find how many criminals remain at t = infinity\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. Criminals moving in the same direction will never meet (they maintain their relative positions)\n2. Criminals moving in opposite directions (N-S, E-W) can potentially meet\n3. For two criminals to meet:\n   - They must be on the same row (for E-W movement) or same column (for N-S movement)\n   - They must be moving toward each other\n   - The time it takes for them to meet must be positive\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. For each pair of criminals, check if they will meet at some time t > 0\n2. Two criminals meet if:\n   - One is moving North and the other South, and they have the same x-coordinate, with the North criminal having smaller y-coordinate\n   - One is moving East and the other West, and they have the same y-coordinate, with the East criminal having larger x-coordinate\n   - They meet at the midpoint, and the meeting time is positive\n3. When criminals meet, they both vanish\n4. We need to simulate meetings in chronological order to handle chain reactions\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n1. Parse input to get criminal positions and directions\n2. For each possible meeting time, check all pairs of criminals that could meet at that time\n3. Remove criminals that meet\n4. Continue until no more meetings are possible\n5. Count remaining criminals\n\nLet me implement this solution:\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"def solve():\\n    n = int(input())\\n    criminals = []\\n    \\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        x, y, d = input().split()\\n        criminals.append((int(x), int(y), d))\\n    \\n    # Convert to list for easier manipulation\\n    remaining = list(criminals)\\n    \\n    # Keep track of meetings\\n    meetings_happened = True\\n    \\n    while meetings_happened:\\n        meetings_happened = False\\n        # Dictionary to store meetings at specific times/positions\\n        meetings = {}\\n        \\n        # Check all pairs of remaining criminals\\n        for i in range(len(remaining)):\\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(remaining)):\\n                x1, y1, d1 = remaining[i]\\n                x2, y2, d2 = remaining[j]\\n                \\n                # Check for N-S meetings (same x, different y)\\n                if d1 == 'N' and d2 == 'S' and x1 == x2:\\n                    if y1 < y2:  # They're moving toward each other\\n                        meet_time = (y2 -
