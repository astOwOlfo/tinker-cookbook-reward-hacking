I like treasure hunts. Love \u2018em. And TROIKA 2013 has the best one ever in \u2018MIST\u2019 (apps.facebook.com/mist_troika). \nJust like a normal treasure hunt, you are given several clues and you have to get the right answer to progress to the next level and so on, until you reach the ultimate prize! But the organizers have learnt that a lot of users are not progressing even after figuring out the correct answer; it seems \u2018someone\u2019 forgot to code in \u2018possible variants of the correct answer\u2019 for each level. For example, if \u201cSachin Tendulkar\u201d happened to be the answer to a particular level, \u201cTendulkar\u201d or \u201ctendulkar\u201d or \u201csachin tendulkar\u201d wasn\u2019t accepted as correct. This is what you have to rectify.\nGiven the expected answer \u2018S\u2019, your job is to modify the answer-verification-system to be able to allow acceptable variants of \u2018S\u2019.\nIf the user enters an acceptable variant ,terminate the program. You can assume that the user is intelligent enough so that he will enter the answer in an order specified by the string S i.e he will not enter anything like \u201cTendulkar Sachin\u201d if the answer is \u201cSachin Tendulkar\u201d however he can enter \u201cTendulkar\u201d.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a string S.\nThe next few lines contain the input string P entered by the user.\n\nOutput\nFor every line entered by the user output \u201cYes\u201d if the string is acceptable and \u201cNo\u201d if it is not.
