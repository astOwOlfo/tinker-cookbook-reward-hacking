We can compute the next multiple using simple arithmetic.\n- If `n` is divisible by `k`, the result is `n + k`.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n```\nx = n + k - (n % k)\n```\nBut we need to handle the case where `n % k == 0`:\n\n- If `n % k == 0`, then `x = n + k`.\n- Otherwise, `x = n + (k - n % k)`.\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify this into a single expression:\n```\nx = ((n // k) + 1) * k\n```\nThis works because:\n- `n // k` gives the largest factor of `k` less than or equal to `n`.\n- Adding 1 to it gives the next factor.\n- Multiplying by `k` gives the next multiple of `k` greater than `n`.\n\n### Implementation:\nWe\u2019ll read the input, compute `x` as described, and output it.\n\nLet me write this into `solution.py`.\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"n, k = map(int, input().split())\\nx = ((n // k) + 1) * k\\nprint(x)\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"n, k = map(int, input().split())\\nx = ((n // k) + 1) * k\\nprint(x)\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Now that the solution file has been created, I will run the tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.\n\n"}, {"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: ============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /testbed\nplugins: timeout-2.4.0\ncollected 8 items\n\ntests.py ........
