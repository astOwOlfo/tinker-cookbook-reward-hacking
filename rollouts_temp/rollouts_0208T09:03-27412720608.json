Apparently, he is the most feared poker player at present with a net worth of $ 10 Million. Because of his good guessing power and confidence to rely on it, not only his wins, but his folds are also epic.\n\nOne evening while playing poker he made a terrible mistake and lost all the chips to his opponents. In order to get more chips he went to play a game. \n\nThere are N pots placed in a circle, ith pot contains Ai number of chips. Dwan can pick any number of the pots, but he is not allowed to choose adjacent pots. What is the maximum number of chips he could collect?\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of pots.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the number of chips in each pot.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum number of chips he could collect.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 110\n\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 2.5*10^4\n\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^7\n\nUse Fast I/O\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n1\n6\n25 1 25 1 25 30\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n75\n\nExplanation\n\nMaximum chips he could collect is 75 (A1=25,A3=25,A5=25). Pot 6 could not be picked because he had to leave pot 1 for that (as pots are arranged in a circle).\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import sys\\n\\ndef solve_linear(nums):\\n    n = len(nums)\\n    if n == 0:\\n        return 0\\n    if n == 1:\\n        return nums[0]\\n    \\n    # dp[i] represents maximum sum up to index i without picking adjacent elements\\n    dp = [0] * n\\n    dp[0] = nums[0]\\n    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])\\n    \\n    for i in range(2, n):\\n        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])\\n    \\n    return dp[-1]\\n\\ndef solve_circular(nums):\\n    n = len(nums)\\n    if n == 1:\\n        return nums[0]\\n    \\n    # Two cases: include first element (exclude last), exclude first element (can include last)\\n    return max(solve_linear(nums[:-1]), solve_linear(nums[1:]))\\n\\ndef main():\\n    input = sys.stdin.read\\n    data = input().split()\\n    \\n    t = int(data[0])\\n    index = 1\\n    results = []\\n    \\n    for _ in range(t):\\n        n = int(data[index])\\n        index += 1\\n        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))\\n        index += n\\n        \\n        result = solve_circular(nums)\\n        results.append(str(result))\\n    \\n    print('\\\\n'.join(results))\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "create_file", "arguments": "{\"path\": \"/testbed/solution.py\", \"content\": \"import sys\\n\\ndef solve_linear(nums):\\n    n = len(nums)\\n    if n == 0:\\n        return 0\\n    if n == 1:\\n        return nums[0]\\n    \\n    # dp[i] represents maximum sum up to index i without picking adjacent elements\\n    dp = [0] * n\\n    dp[0] = nums[0]\\n    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])\\n    \\n    for i in range(2, n):\\n        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])\\n    \\n    return dp[-1]\\n\\ndef solve_circular(nums):\\n    n = len(nums)\\n    if n == 1:\\n        return nums[0]\\n    \\n    # Two cases: include first element (exclude last), exclude first element (can include last)\\n    return max(solve_linear(nums[:-1]), solve_linear(nums[1:]))\\n\\ndef main():\\n    input = sys.stdin.read\\n    data = input().split()\\n    \\n    t = int(data[0])\\n    index = 1\\n    results = []\\n    \\n    for _ in range(t):\\n        n = int(data[index])\\n        index += 1\\n        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))\\n        index += n\\n        \\n        result = solve_circular(nums)\\n        results.append(str(result))\\n    \\n    print('\\\\n'.join(results))\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 2 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 0\n\nSTDOUT: Successfully wrote to file '/testbed/solution.py'.\n\n\nSTDERR: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "tool_call", "tool_call": {"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}}], "tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "id": null, "function": {"name": "bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pytest /testbed/tests.py\"}"}}]}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have 1 remaining tool calls.\n\nHere is the output of the tool you called:\n\nEXIT CODE: 4\n\nSTDOUT: ============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /testbed\nplugins: timeout-2.4.0\ncollected 0 items\n\n============================ no tests ran in 0.00s =============================\n\n\nSTDERR: ERROR: file or directory not found: /testbed/tests.py\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "It seems that the test file does not exist at the specified location.
