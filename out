There is no guarantee that all output will be returned in a\nsingle call. Call this function multiple times to retrieve additional\noutput from the shell.\n\nUSAGE NOTES:\n- Ensure that the shell is at a command prompt (typically when the\n  output ends in "$ " or "# ") before submitting a new command.\n- Control characters must be sent as Unicode escape sequences (e.g., use\n  "\\u0003" for Ctrl+C/ETX, "\\u0004" for Ctrl+D/EOT). The literal string\n  "Ctrl+C" will not be interpreted as a control character.\n- Use the "read" action to retrieve output from the shell without\n  sending any input. This is useful for long-running commands that\n  produce output over time. The "read" action will return any new output\n  since the last call.\n- If a long-running command is in progress, additional input to execute\n  a new command will not be processed until the previous completes. To\n  abort a long-running command, use the "interrupt" action:\n  `bash_session(action="interrupt")`\n\nExample use case:\n- For a short-running command with a nominal amount of output, a single\n  call may suffice.\n  ```\n  bash_session(action="type_submit", input="echo foo") -> "foo\\nuser@host:/# "\n  ```\n- For a long-running command with output over time, multiple calls to are needed.\n  ```\n  bash_session(action="type_submit", input="tail -f /tmp/foo.log") -> <some output>\n  bash_session(action="read") -> <more output>\n  # Send interrupt (Ctrl+C)\n  bash_session(action="interrupt") -> "<final output>^Cuser@host:/# "\n  ```\n- Interactive command awaiting more input from the user.\n  ```\n  bash_session(action="type_submit", input="ssh fred@foo.com") -> "foo.com\'s password: "\n  bash_session(action="type_submit", input="secret") -> "fred@foo.com:~$ "\n  ```'}, 'limit': None}asyncio:1879 [[91mERROR[0m] Task exception was never retrieved
